    The "repos" attribute is now called "root", which is
    consistent with the rest of the Pinto tools.  You'll
    need to change your dist.ini files accordingly.

    You can now release to multiple repositories by specifying
    multiple values for the "root" attribute. [ Thanks reneeb! ]

    You'll be prompted to enter your author ID if we can't
    figure out your username.

    Now requires either Pinto-0.030 or Pinto::Remote-0.030 or
    higher (depending on whether you release to local or
    remote repositories).  Just as before, neither of these
    are explicit dependencies, so you have to choose the
    right one and install it manually.

    No new functionality, but now matches the API of the current
    versions of Pinto and Pinto::Remote.  So you must have either
    Pinto >= 0.028 or Pinto::Rmote >= 0.028.

    The version number for D::Z::P::Pinto::Add has been increased
    to correspond to the minimum Pinto version that is required.

    We now ping the Pinto repository before trying to release.  If it
    isn't available, you'll be prompted whether to continue the rest
    of the release.

    Ok, that last release flopped because my DZ config was borked.

    Renamed from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReleaseToPinto to
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Pinto::Add.  This gives me room to grow with
    more plugins in the D::Z::Plugin::Pinto namespace.

    Also fixed call to undefined method.

    No interface change.  Just an extra log message when releasing.

    Initial release.
