    No new functionality, but now matches the API of the current
    versions of Pinto and Pinto::Remote.  So you must have either
    Pinto >= 0.028 or Pinto::Rmote >= 0.028.

    The version number for D::Z::P::Pinto::Add has been increased
    to correspond to the minimum Pinto version that is required.

    We now ping the Pinto repository before trying to release.  If it
    isn't available, you'll be prompted whether to continue the rest
    of the release.

    Ok, that last release flopped because my DZ config was borked.

    Renamed from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReleaseToPinto to
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Pinto::Add.  This gives me room to grow with
    more plugins in the D::Z::Plugin::Pinto namespace.

    Also fixed call to undefined method.

    No interface change.  Just an extra log message when releasing.
